> Here’s a focused, high‑impact set of improvements to the VQ flow and its integration, with
  concrete code touchpoints.

  Integration correctness

  - Wire child VQ across levels: Pass the lower level’s quantizer to the next level’s expander
  so it predicts child digits instead of a flat K.
      - Where: components/abstractinator_pyramid.py::__init__
      - Change: track prev_vq as levels[-1].hi_quantizer (or levels[-1].compressor.quantizer)
  and pass as lo_vq to the next Abstractinator.
  - Use factorized CE when predicting multi‑stage digits:
      - Where: components/abstractinator.py::forward
      - Change: if self.lo_codec.depth > 1, call compute_code_loss() and sum per‑stage CE;
  don’t just train stage_logits[0].

  Training signals and stability

  - Warm‑up quantization:
      - Start with low beta (commitment) and EMA disabled, ramp over N steps.
      - Or briefly use soft/relaxed codes (e.g., Gumbel‑Softmax on stage logits) for a small
  warm‑up window before hard argmin.
      - Where: schedule in train.py or add a warmup_steps knob inside MultiStageResidualVQ to
  temporarily skip argmin.
  - Per‑stage usage regularization:
      - Add a small entropy bonus on stage usage (discourage collapse to few codes).
      - Where: compute per‑stage usage from VectorQuantizer.ema_cluster_size and add a
  weighted term to total loss (guarded by config).
  - Code reset policy:
      - Gate resets by both low usage and “staleness” (time since last assignment).
      - Where: VectorQuantizer._maybe_vectorized_reset(); maintain a small “last hit” EMA
  (0‑dim) per code and include that in dead_mask.
  - Keep codebooks mixed‑precision safe:
      - Compute distances and EMA updates in fp32 regardless of model dtype.
      - Where: wrap distance/EMA blocks with torch.amp.autocast(enabled=False) or cast to
  float().

  Performance

  - Prefer digits over composed ids internally:
      - Store digits: List[(B,Q)] alongside vq_indices in CompressorOutput to avoid repeated
  compose/decompose overhead and very large composed domains when depth > 2.
      - Where: components/segment_compressor.py::forward
  - Hoist codebook reads:
      - When computing stage logits, prefetch stage_codebook(s) once per layer/step (they’re
  detached) and reuse.
      - Where: components/vector_quantizer.py::rvq_stage_logits
  - Cache codebook norms:
      - For squared‑distance logits, maintain cached ||e||^2 per stage (updates only when
  codebook changes).
      - Where: in adapter or head; invalidate/update when stage_codebook changes.

  API simplifications

  - Unify naming and exposure:
      - Rename Abstractinator.hi_quantizer → quantizer and always access quantizer via
  level.compressor.quantizer to eliminate stale attributes (.vq) across the repo.
      - Ensure CompressorOutput always carries vq_depth, K, and optionally digits for clarity.
  - Explicit detach rules:
      - Document and enforce that expander helpers read codebooks detached (no grads into
  compressor’s VQ).
  - Single source of special tokens:
      - Centralize special IDs (BOS/EOS/EOP/PAD) in a shared structure and thread them into
  all VQs/adapters consistently (already mostly done; make it explicit).

  Better monitoring

  - Per‑stage perplexity and resets:
      - Log stage‑wise perplexity, reset counts, and fraction of “dead” codes per stage/level.
      - Where: produce lists in AbstractinatorPyramid.forward under a new key (e.g.,
  vq_stage_metrics) and aggregate in components/metrics.py.
  - Usage histograms (optional artifact):
      - Periodically dump usage histograms (per stage) as MLflow artifacts to visualize spread
  over time.

  Top‑LM and discrete prior (optional)

  - If you plan a discrete top LM later, expose the top quantizer cleanly:
      - Wire model.top_lm.vq = model.levels[-1].compressor.quantizer so it can quantize
  predictions and emit indices/VQ loss.
      - Consider an auxiliary “code prior” loss at the top over digits (factorized CE) for
  Stage‑2.

  Doc/tests polish

  - Unit tests:
      - Tests for compose/decompose roundtrip on random digits.
      - Test that expander heads do not backprop into compressor codebooks (grad check).

  Concrete minimal patches I can do next (if you want)

  - Wire lo_vq across levels in AbstractinatorPyramid.
  - Switch Abstractinator.forward() to use compute_code_loss() when lo_codec.depth > 1.
  - Add per‑stage metrics (perplexity/resets) to outputs/metrics.
  - Make CompressorOutput optionally return digits to avoid recompute (no behavior change
  elsewhere).

  These changes keep the current design but make multi‑level RVQ training correct by default,
  improve stability, and add visibility into codebook health without blowing up complexity.
